Little backstory. This website started around August 2018 when I decided that I want to make a website from scratch to practice HTML and CSS. I enjoyed watching a lot of Stray Kids contents so I decided I want to make a website about them. My inspiration was a Wanna One website that archives Wanna One contents. There was also a post by a STAY that has Stray Kids existing contents. I forgot if it was from Reddit or another website but the post said something like "It will be hard to catch up on Stray Kids future contents so here are some of it"?? I... can't remember... That post was really helpful <3 What I can remember is the last video I watched with that post's help is the 3NORACHA  V Live :D

While collecting links from YouTube and V LIVE I found more gems! I'm also starting to get really into Stray Kids when I was making this website. I enjoyed listening to Stray Kids and 3RACHA songs on Spotify and YouTube while coding too.

August 24, 2018. I first shared the website from my first stan account and the site was called [skzshows](https://skzshows.netlify.com) before (it's still alive hahaha). Then December 10, I moved to [ch-skz](https://ch-skz.netlify.com).
