There were STAYs that reached out to me asking how can they easily see Stray Kids contents from 2017 to 2021 because the home page only displays 2021. I was asked if I can make the same list by dates starting from 2017 so I decided to finally worked on the update ^^. The all contents by date was up since Sep. 26 and I started to work on content summary after that. I had summary each year from the previous version of my site and it took me long to finally work on bringing it back on the new version. And finally I finished the Summary page! Yay!!! I hope it will be helpful for STAYs who want to look back on what contents Stray Kids released each year and I put most of them in chronological order to make it a journey from pre-debut to now. Because Summary page is already up, I'm going to rearrange the Shows page in non-chronological order and separate the complete series and ongoing ones. I don't know if it's necessary but I want to provide other options ^_^
