# What to do?

Here's a summary of things you may do to support Stray Kids. Please read them all and see what you can do. It may look a lot specially for Baby STAYs but don't worry because Stray Kids fanbases are there to guide you. It's easy!

In case you don't know what _Music Show Win_ is, it happens during their album promotion. The No. 1 song of the week is announced per music show and each music show has different criteria for it. Criteria is usually composed of YouTube streaming (FREE), voting on apps (FREE), buying physical album, and streaming on Korean streaming platforms (biggest criteria). We only have few weeks to give Stray Kids Music Show Wins every comeback and there may not be next time for this album that's why STAYs all around the world are encouraged to help participate.

> FREE as long as you have access to internet.

Here's a detailed information about all Korean music shows criteria provided by KShowAnalysis. Stray Kids don't promote and not eligible to win on The Show so you may ignore it. {{< tweet 1359377074717290496 >}}

## Korean Digital Sales

## Voting

## YouTube Streaming

One of the easiest and free to do is to stream the MV on YouTube. It's advisable to get YouTube Premium so you can stream in background or even when your device screen is off. You may get a 1 month Premium free trial and make sure to cancel it before the 1 month ends to avoid paying for it after the free trial ends. Streaming without premium is also okay.

There are different methods to stream an MV a lot but the most advisable is doing Manual method.

1. Log in to your YouTube account.
2. Go to the video by doing any of these:

* Searching with the keyword for example "Ïä§Ìä∏Î†àÏù¥ ÌÇ§Ï¶à \[title track\]" or "Stray Kids \[title track\]".
* Clicking from home page or recommended video.
* Clicking the shared link of the video.

1. Stream the video with proper setting. Follow do's and don'ts:

* After watching the video: like, leave a good comment about the MV (don't spam!), and share to your SNS or website.
* Quality should be at least 480p.
* Volume should be at least 50%.
* Speed must be normal.
* Don't skip time, pause, and replay.
* Turn off autoplay.
* If using desktop/laptop don't stream on multiple tabs.
* If streaming with more than one device, make sure that different accounts are logged in and device are in different IP address.

1. Stream other videos (fillers) around 3-4 videos with a total of at least 10-min long before you watch the MV again. Example videos are Stray Kids MV, skz-player, skz-record, performances from different channels, etc. Make sure you don't stream the same videos every time you stream in between the MV.
2. Repeat from step 2.

You may see different tutorials on how to do manual streaming but the most important thing is to not let YouTube think you are a robot. The following are my personal tips:

* Interact with comments every other time.
* Either skip or don't skip ads but if the ad is the Stray Kids MV do not skip it.
* Don't stream for too long, you may rest after few rounds and then do it again.
* Log in to different accounts.
* Change methods of going to videos (step 2).
* Change number of fillers each round.
* You may either search or click recommendations for the fillers.
* Stream non-kpop videos, if you want to watch a video of a cat or a puppy then go :D

### End note

Those are the basics of supporting Stray Kids mainly to get _Music Show Wins_ but also for a chance for them to be nominated on _Award Ceremonies_. There's more we may do to help Stray Kids get more achievements and recognition such as helping with Billboard, international iTunes, Spotify, etc. but I will add those on a different post if this post got engagements.
