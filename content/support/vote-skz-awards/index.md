# Seoul Music Awards (SMA)

Our current main priority for voting. We are voting for **MAIN** a.k.a Bonsang (30% of criteria) and have to be **1st with big gap** on Global + Korean polls combined to secure an award.

Voting is ongoing and will end on **Jan 16, 2022**. Click the tweet to see the full guide.

# Gaon Music Chart Awards (GMCA)

Voting for **Mubeat Global Choice Awards** will be on Mubeat app.  It's best to save votes for **Final Round** as long as Stray Kids are within the **Top 20 (Round 1)** and **Top 10 (Round 2)** and only use voting tickets if it is going to expire. We need to win **1st Place on Final Round** to get the award.
