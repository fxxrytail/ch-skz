The list of main award shows voting will be put here. It will mean a lot to show our support for Stray Kids❣️ Let's work together STAY❤️

# FAN N STAR (Four Star Award)

**Four Star Award** is given to the 1st place only among the 4th Generation Idols that are nominated. It is purely base on fan voting. Winner will be determined by combining the early series of voting (30%) + ongoing voting (70%). Stray Kids have to keep up with a big gap on the ongoing voting to catch up to 1st place!

**FOUR STAR Award** winner will be announced on July 1 and the trophy will be given during **THE FACT MUSIC AWARDS** on October 8.

Let's all work together for our 4th Generation Leader Stray Kids! Encourage STAYs from all around the world and platforms to vote~!
