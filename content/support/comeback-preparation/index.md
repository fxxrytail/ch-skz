# What to do?
Here's a summary of things you may do to support Stray Kids. Please read them all and see what you can do. It may look a lot specially for Baby STAYs but don't worry because {{<a "Stray Kids fanbases" "LINK">}} are there to guide you. It's easy!


In case you don't know what *Music Show Win* is, it happens during their album promotion. The No. 1 song of the week is announced per music show and each music show has different criteria for it. Criteria is usually composed of YouTube streaming (FREE), voting on apps (FREE), buying physical album, and streaming on Korean streaming platforms (most important). We only have few weeks to give Stray Kids a Music Show Win for "NOEASY" and there may not be next time for this album that's why STAYs all around the world are encouraged to help participate.

## YouTube Streaming
One of the easiest and free to do is to stream the MV on YouTube. It's advisable to get YouTube Premium so you can stream in background or even when your device screen is off. You may get a 1 month Premium free trial and make sure to cancel it before the 1 month ends to avoid paying for it after the free trial ends.
